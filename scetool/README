==> Compilation <==
Install Zig 0.12.0-dev.2075+f5978181e
 - `zig build -Dtarget=[target triple] -Doptimize=ReleaseSmall` target triple can be things like `x86_64-windows` or `x86-macos` or `aarch64-linux-gnu` or any combination, or you can omit the target to build for your native platform

==> Packaging <==
 -  `zig build package`

==> Setup <==
 - /data/keys : Keyfile.
 - /data/ldr_curves : Loader curves (7744 bytes).
 - /data/vsh_curves : VSH curves (360 bytes).
 - /data/idps : IDPS as binary file
 - /data/act.dat : act.dat
 - /rifs/* : *.rif files
 - /raps/* : *.rap files

==> Keyfile Format <==
 [keyname]
 type={SELF, RVK, PKG, SPP, OTHER}
 revision={00, ..., 18, 8000}
 version={..., 0001000000000000, ...}
 self_type={LV0, LV1, LV2, APP, ISO, LDR, UNK_7, NPDRM}
 key=...
 erk=...
 riv=...
 pub=...
 priv=...
 ctype=...

==> Keyset Example <==
 [metldr]
 type=SELF
 revision=00
 self_type=LDR
 erk=0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

 pub=00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
 priv=000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
 ctype=00

==> NPDRM Key(set) Names <==
 - [NP_tid]: Title ID OMAC1 key.
 - [NP_ci]: Control info OMAC1 key.
 - [NP_klic_free]: Free klicensee.
 - [NP_klic_key]: klicensee key.
 - [NP_idps_const]: IDPS constant.
 - [NP_rif_key]: rif key.
 - [NP_sig]: Footer signature ECDSA keyset.

==> Override Keyset <==
 It should be a single hex-string consisting of: 
 32 bytes (Key) 16 bytes (IV) 40 bytes (Pub) 21 bytes (Priv) 1 byte (CType).
